          <h2>About Me: A Pizzeria Owner Turned Software Engineer</h2>
          <p class="lead about mb-3" align="left"><br>I have always had a strong work ethic.
            It's due to this that I tend to get promotions frequently.
            When I worked at Target, I was promoted to Food Avenue Team Lead months after getting hired.
            That was how I got into the Food Industry.
            From there, I went to a small company called Gourmet Specialty Foods as a shipper/receiver.
            I was then promoted to the Quality Assurance department under their Food Scientist so I could help build their <a href="https://www.sqfi.com/what-is-the-sqf-program/" target="_blank">Safe Quality Foods</a> program.
            A few months later, he was gone and it was up to me to run the QA Department.
            I say that, but it was just me doing all of the QA work.
            I eventually heard that the owner of a local pizzeria was planning on retiring and met with him.
            We had known each other for decades so he was willing to sit with me.
            After work I would go to the pizza shop and learn the ropes until, a few months later, I purchased the shop from him.
            <br><br>
            It was difficult. I was working nearly 90 hours a week for pay that was on par with my previous position... but I enjoyed it.
            Work didn't feel like work. I had employees to take care of and got to call a few customers friends.
            Unfortunately, there's a lot of competition in the fast food industry and sales started to decline.
            We were operating with the previous week's income (which is a nightmare).
            I stopped paying myself to make sure my employees and ingredients were covered.
            Then I got a part-time job at Best Buy so I could have income of my own, but it wasn't enough.
            My shop was struggling by the time quarantine hit.
            The immediate loss of business drove me under and forced me to look towards different pastures.
            I've always been into tech hardware and went full-time at Best Buy in Geek Squad.
            I quickly learned that making software talk to each other was tricky (considering Best Buy and Apple's software had many problems), but we made it work.
            I had been thinking about what to do with myself now that my business had failed and I was working a job with clients that were beyond rude.
            My friends told me about <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>'s Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, and that it was a great way to jumpstart a career in software development.
            I did a lot of research and eventually agreed.
          </p>
          <p class="lead about"> I decided to take the plunge.</p>
